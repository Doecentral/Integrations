## Getting started

Before using the command, you need to retrieve your d≈ìcentral API token. You can find it in the [API key settings view](https://app.d≈ìcentral.com/?settings&apikeys).

## Features

- See your all your tasks due today
- See your all your tasks due tomorrow

For each task, you can:

- Open the task in source app (`‚èé`)
- See if the task is recurring or not [planned]
- See the task's priority with a colored circle [planned]
<!--
- Complete the task (`‚áß` + `‚åò` + `C` or `‚åò` + `‚èé`)
- Schedule the task (`‚áß` + `‚åò` + `S`)
  - Today
  - Tomorrow
  - Next week
- Change its priority (`‚áß` + `‚åò` + `P`)
  - Low (`p1`)
  - Medium (`p2`)
  - High (`p3`)
  - Urgent (`p4`)
- Delete the task (`‚áß` + `‚åò` + `X`)
- Filter the tasks
  - By name
  - By priority: p1, p2, p3, p4
  - By project name if the list is date-based
-->

## Pro tips

- `‚å•` + `T` to see the "Today" view
